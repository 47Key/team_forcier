# Website for a Real Estate Team/Agent

* Pre-built website for a real estate team, or individual agent, to implement their own listings or listing from a national shared pool.


### Todo

* Finish individual property page and url params for MLS# in the slug.
* Optimize hero image, and property images if possible. Hero image can be optimized with slight tweaks in adobe photoshop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Implement db auth, data is not important but still would be good practice.
* Implement dark mode (maybe)
* Finish modal styling, still needs a touch up.
